# Fullstack Development Skill

## Description
This skill provides expertise in both frontend and backend development, covering the complete technology stack needed to build end-to-end web applications from user interface to server infrastructure.

## Capabilities
- Develop complete web applications from scratch
- Integrate frontend and backend components seamlessly
- Design and implement full application architecture
- Handle authentication across frontend and backend
- Manage database design and frontend data flow
- Implement real-time features (websockets, live updates)
- Handle deployment of both frontend and backend
- Troubleshoot issues across the entire stack
- Optimize performance for both client and server
- Ensure consistency between UI/UX and API design
- Implement proper error handling throughout the stack
- Manage cross-cutting concerns (logging, monitoring)
- Coordinate frontend-backend communication
- Handle environment configurations for all tiers

## Best Practices
- Maintain separation of concerns between layers
- Follow consistent coding standards across stack
- Implement proper API design for frontend consumption
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Apply security measures at all levels
- Implement proper error boundaries and handling
- Optimize asset delivery and caching strategies
- Use consistent data formats across stack
- Apply proper testing strategies for all layers
- Implement proper CI/CD pipelines
- Maintain documentation for all components
- Follow DRY principles across the stack
- Plan for scalability of both frontend and backend

## Technologies & Tools
